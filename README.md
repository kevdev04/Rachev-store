# Rachev store 

My co-worker is rachelle and we decided to make this project because we wanted to learn about responsive design and the e-commerce logic
here there's more about her: https://rachelles-website.rachellef.repl.co/index.html

The name of the project means a combination between our names.
we made this project thinking in real life problems that's why this project is an e-commerce and also it was a good taste of how to work as a team

here you can see the demo: https://rachev-store.vercel.app/
